/**
 * Public storefront read layer for public.products.
 *
 * WHY THIS USES THE ANON CLIENT RATHER THAN src/server/repos/products.ts
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * There were two existing patterns to choose from and they are not
 * interchangeable:
 *
 *   - src/server/repos/*.ts run on supabaseAdmin() (service_role). service_role
 *     **bypasses RLS entirely**. Reaching for it here would mean the only thing
 *     standing between the storefront and every draft/archived product is a
 *     `.eq("status", "active")` that a future refactor can drop without any
 *     test noticing. Those repos are also `import "@tanstack/react-start/server-only"`
 *     and belong to the back office.
 *
 *   - src/lib/cms.ts runs on the anon client from src/lib/supabase.ts. The anon
 *     key can only ever see what RLS lets it see, and
 *     supabase/migrations/0004_commerce_products.sql already encodes exactly the
 *     rule this file needs:
 *         create policy products_select_public ... using (status = 'active')
 *     so non-active rows are unreachable at the database level, not merely
 *     unselected here. The same migration revokes every write, and
 *     0005_commerce_orders.sql gives anon *no* grants at all on
 *     orders/payments/etc — so this client is structurally incapable of leaking
 *     order data even if someone later asks it to.
 *
 * This file therefore follows the cms.ts pattern. The `.eq("status", "active")`
 * below is defence in depth on top of the policy, not the primary control.
 *
 * Note also that no createServerFn is involved: like every other public read in
 * this app, these run from TanStack Router loaders, which execute on the server
 * during SSR (so crawlers get real HTML) and in the browser on client-side
 * navigation (so no extra round-trip). That is the established convention here
 * — see src/routes/curated.tsx.
 *
 * ONE DELIBERATE DEPARTURE FROM cms.ts
 * ------------------------------------
 * cms.ts swallows every error and substitutes bundled copy, because site copy
 * has a sensible in-repo fallback. Products do not: there is no bundled
 * catalogue, so "the query failed" and "nothing is for sale" would collapse
 * into the same empty list and the shop would quietly look closed during a DB
 * hiccup. These functions therefore still never throw, but they report the
 * distinction via `unavailable` so the UI can say "temporarily unavailable"
 * instead of "no products".
