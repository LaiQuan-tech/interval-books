/**
 * Shopping cart — zustand + persist(localStorage).
 *
 * Ported from the same team's Realreal storefront
 * (apps/web/src/lib/cart.ts), keeping its two hard-won behaviours:
 *
 *   1. every mutation clamps against the latest known purchase limit, so a
 *      quantity that exceeds stock can never enter the cart in the first
 *      place; and
 *   2. `skipHydration: true` — the store starts empty on both the server and
 *      the first client render, and is only rehydrated from localStorage
 *      inside an effect. Without this, SSR renders an empty cart, the client
 *      immediately renders a full one, and React reports a hydration mismatch.
 *
 * Four deliberate departures from the Realreal original:
 *
 *   - **No toast() inside the store.** Realreal calls sonner from inside the
 *     `set()` updater, which hardcodes Traditional Chinese strings into a state
 *     reducer. This site is zh/en/ja, so the mutations instead return a result
 *     code and the calling component renders the localized toast. This also
 *     keeps the module free of browser-only imports, so importing it during SSR
 *     is harmless.
 *   - **`partialize`** — Realreal persists the whole state and relies on
 *     JSON.stringify dropping the functions. Naming `items` explicitly means a
 *     future derived field cannot accidentally start being written to disk.
 *   - **`version` + `migrate`** — Realreal has neither, so a shape change would
 *     silently merge stale localStorage into the new code. Anything not written
 *     by the current version is discarded rather than trusted.
 *   - **`syncFromCatalogue`** — a cart line is a snapshot taken at add time.
 *     Realreal patches only the price (updatePrice) and leaves stock stale,
 *     which means a limit enforced against a week-old snapshot. Here the cart
 *     route reconciles every line against the live catalogue on load, so
 *     price, copy and the remaining-quantity cap are current, and products that
 *     have since been de-listed or sold out are visibly flagged rather than
 *     silently carried forward.
 *
 * Checkout and payment are explicitly out of scope for this module; nothing
 * here talks to the server, and the cart is browser-local only.
 *
 * ⚠️ 參加者姓名／聯絡方式**不在這裡**，而且不可以搬進來。
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 * 0020 之後活動報名要逐位填寫參加者，最順手的做法是把那幾筆資料掛在 CartLine 上
 * 一路帶到結帳。**不要這樣做。** 這個 store 會被 persist() 寫進 localStorage，
 * 那等於把第三人的姓名與電話留在瀏覽器裡，沒有到期時間，也沒有任何一頁告訴使用者
 * 它在那裡。參加者資料只在 /checkout 的表單狀態裡活著，送出之後就交給伺服器 ——
 * 一次結帳一次，不落地。
 *
 * 購物車只記「哪一場、幾個位子」（sessionId + qty），那是報價需要的全部。
