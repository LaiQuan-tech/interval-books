/**
 * Data layer for the checkout tables (orders / order_items / order_addresses).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IS THE ONLY WAY IN
 * --------------------------------
 * supabase/migrations/0005_commerce_orders.sql turns RLS on for all eight
 * commerce tables and creates **zero policies**, then revokes every grant from
 * anon and authenticated. There is no query the browser can write that reaches
 * these tables — not a select, not an insert. service_role bypasses RLS, so
 * this module (and only this module) can touch them, and it is reachable only
 * from src/lib/checkout-fns.ts.
 *
 * That also means the usual safety net is gone: the database will not
 * second-guess anything sent from here. Every rule the checkout depends on —
 * what a line costs, whether a product is on sale, how much shipping is — is
 * enforced *in this file*, from values re-read out of public.products. The
 * browser's only contribution is a list of (product_id, quantity) pairs.
 *
 * THERE IS NO TRANSACTION HERE, AND THAT SHAPES THE ORDER OF OPERATIONS
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------
 * PostgREST gives one statement per round trip; `begin … commit` around four
 * writes is not available. So the sequence below is arranged so that the only
 * step that can leave the database wrong is the last one, and everything
 * before it is undoable:
 *
 *   1. read products, recompute money, pre-check availability   (no writes)
 *   2. insert orders                                            (undo: delete)
 *   3. insert order_items                                       (undo: cascade)
 *   4. insert order_addresses                                   (undo: cascade)
 *  4b. insert invoices (the shopper's invoice choice)            (undo: cascade)
 *   5. reserve_session_seat() per booking line                   (undo: delete)
 *  6a. reserve_inventory_stock() for inventory-backed lines      (undo: delete)
 *  6b. atomic_deduct_stock() for every catalog-stock line        (no undo needed)
 *   7. record the payment intent and build the gateway hand-off (see below)
 *
 * Deleting the orders row cascades to order_items, order_addresses and invoices
 * (all three declare `on delete cascade`), so undoing 2–4b is a single delete.
 * Step 6b is
 * last on purpose: it is all-or-nothing inside one function call, so if it
 * raises, no stock moved, and there is no later step that could fail after it
 * succeeded. That is what makes "restore the stock" a case that cannot arise.
 *
 * Step 6a is new (migration 0011) and sits in front of 6b rather than replacing
 * it, because the two manage different products: 6b owns the ones whose stock
 * lives in public.products, 6a owns the ones sold out of the shop's real
 * inventory (inv.products). A product is never both — 0011 has a trigger that
 * refuses to let a linked product carry a catalog stock number at all.
 *
 * 6a is placed before 6b specifically because it is the undoable one. It writes
 * only to stock_reservations and never moves physical stock, so its rollback is
 * a delete rather than a compensating write — which means an abandoned checkout
 * leaves the inventory system with no sales row and no stock movement at all.
 * That is the property this whole design exists to buy; see 0011's header.
 *
 * Step 5 changed shape in migration 0020 and is worth re-reading. It used to be
 * reserve_product_seat(product_id, quantity), which moved a counter on
 * public.products and nothing else. It is now
 * reserve_session_seat(order_id, order_item_id, session_id, quantity,
 * participants) — one call that takes the seats on public.event_sessions AND
 * writes the N attendee rows, in one statement.
 *
 * That is not a convenience. `order_items.quantity = N ⇒ N registrations` is a
 * cross-row invariant, and there is no transaction here to enforce it across
 * two calls (see the paragraph above: PostgREST gives one statement per round
 * trip). Splitting it would mean a window where the seats are taken and nobody
 * knows who is sitting in them — and orders created inside that window would
 * survive it. Migration 0020 §2 works through why a deferred constraint trigger
 * cannot express this either.
 *
 * It is still one call per booking line, so an order with two sittings is two
 * calls and the second can fail after the first succeeded. The undo is now
 * release_session_seat(order_item_id), whose DELETE … RETURNING is its own
 * idempotent claim — strictly better than the read/compare-and-swap/retry loop
 * this file used to run, and it gives the attendee rows back along with the
 * seats.
 *
 * ⚠️ The order inside the catch block is load-bearing: release BEFORE delete.
 *    event_registrations cascades from order_items, which cascades from orders,
 *    so deleting the order first would take the attendee rows away while
 *    event_sessions.seats_taken kept counting them. Nothing would ever notice.
 *
 * Step 5 is also the only place a browser-supplied id points at a row other
 * than the product it is paying for: `sessionId`. reserve_session_seat() step ③
 * refuses a session whose product is not this line's product, and refuses an
 * order_item that belongs to another order. Do not remove that check on the
 * grounds that this file "already knows" — this file is exactly what a tampered
 * payload is trying to talk its way past.
 *
 * Step 7 is outside that scheme on purpose: it happens after the order is
 * durable, and its only writes (the payments audit row and orders.payment_url)
 * are records, not state. If it fails, the order still exists and the shopper
 * can pay again from the confirmation page — which is strictly better than
 * deleting an order whose stock has already been deducted.
 *
 * ⚠️ STEP 7 CHANGED SHAPE：它以前是「記錄付款意圖並組出 PayUni 表單」，現在是
 *    「記錄付款意圖並向**黑貓 PAY（統一客樂得 COCS）**建單，取回線上刷卡網址」。
 *    這家店的商店帳號是黑貓 PAY，PayUni 只是它的收單銀行（acquirer_type），
 *    見 src/server/blackcat.ts 的檔頭。PayUni 直連那條路整支保留成 fallback
 *    （buildPayuniHandoff），一行沒改。
 *
 *    這個改變讓 step 7 從「純本地計算」變成「一次對外的網路呼叫」，所以它現在
 *    **會慢、會逾時、會失敗**。位置沒有跟著改，理由與原本完全相同、而且更重要了：
 *    它在訂單 durable 之後，失敗只是拿不到付款網址 —— 訂單與庫存都還在，客人可以
 *    從確認頁再按一次。把它往前挪到訂單建立之前，才會變成「黑貓慢一秒 = 客人的
 *    庫存與座位全部白扣一次」。
 *
 * Net effect: a failed checkout leaves **no** orders row, hence no order_items
 * and no order_addresses, and leaves stock and seats where they were.
 *
 * WHAT HAPPENS TO THE STOCK IF NOBODY EVER PAYS
 * ---------------------------------------------
 * Stock and seats are taken here, at order time, before a single dollar has
 * moved — so an abandoned payment page holds inventory that nobody can buy.
 * Giving it back is NOT this file's job and must not be added to it: it is
 * public.expire_unpaid_orders() (0006, extended by 0011 to drop the inventory
 * reservations too), which cancels and restores in one transaction. This file
 * only ever takes.
 *
 * WHAT TURNS A RESERVATION INTO A SALE
 * ------------------------------------
 * Nothing in the checkout does. commitInventoryForOrder() below is called from
 * the PayUni webhook once the money is confirmed, and it is the only place an
 * inv.sales row is ever written on behalf of the website.

 * PayUni 是純本地組表單，交易要等瀏覽器 POST 才存在。

 *    金流商導回時只會帶它自己的參數，token 沒有先組進去，確認頁就沒有東西可以
 *    把訂單找回來。
 *
 * ⚠️ apn_url 也在這裡帶上，而且帶的是含 ?k=<BLACKCAT_WEBHOOK_SECRET> 的那一版 ——
 *    那是 APN handler 的第一道閘門（見 blackcat-webhook.ts）。
 *
 * ⚠️ 付款網址寫進 orders.payment_url（0024）。用意是「重新付款」不必再跟黑貓建
 *    第二次單，以及後台看得到這張訂單當初被送去哪裡。寫失敗只 log 不中斷 ——
 *    客人手上已經有網址了，少一筆稽核不值得讓結帳失敗。
 *
 * ⚠️ recordPaymentIntent 在建單**之前**呼叫。順序是刻意的：payments 的唯一索引
 *    (gateway, gateway_tx_id) 是「一個訂單一個金流一筆交易」的資料庫保證，先寫
 *    才能讓「建單成功但我們沒記到」這個對不上帳的情況不存在。它自己吞掉 23505。
 *
 * 未設定完成時回 null 而不是 throw：沒有憑證的部署必須降級成「不經金流」
 * （訂單留著、由店家另行安排付款），絕不可以降級成「結帳失敗」。

    // nothing for a report to pick up. See 0011's header for why writing
    // inv.sales at order time would be wrong.
    //
    // Products with no link row are skipped inside the function, so passing the
    // whole non-booking cart is safe and keeps the decision in one place.

    //
    // Still the last step for the reason the header gives: nothing after it can

  // After the order is durable, never before: if this throws we still want the
  // order to exist so the shopper can retry payment rather than lose the lot.
  //
  // ⚠️ `total > 0` 是 0028 加的。免費訂單在 step 5b 就已經結清了，把它送去金流只會
  //    拿到一個「金額必須大於 0」的錯誤，然後 buildCardHandoff 回 null —— 結果一樣，
  //    但中間白白對外打了一次 API，而且錯誤 log 會誤導。客人在免費活動頁選了刷卡
  //    是完全正常的（頁面上就有那個選項），不是異常。
  const payment = wantsCard && total > 0 ? await buildCardHandoff(order) : null;

  // ---- step 8: 免費訂單的庫存承兌 --------------------------------------------
  // 一般訂單走的是 webhook：markOrderPaid() 之後由 payuni-webhook / blackcat-webhook
  // 呼叫 commitInventoryForOrder()，把 stock_reservations 轉成真正的 inv.sales。
  // 免費訂單**永遠不會有 webhook**，而它現在也不會再被 expire_unpaid_orders() 回收，
  // 所以少了這一句，一張含有 inv 連結品項的免費訂單（0 元贈書之類）留下的保留量會
  // 永遠掛在那裡，把可售量默默扣住 —— 沒有任何排程會補做這一步。
  //
  // 這不違反 commitInventoryForOrder() 檔頭那條「絕不可以從結帳路徑呼叫」：那條規則
  // 守的是「錢還沒進來就寫 inv.sales 是偽造的銷售」，而免費訂單沒有錢會進來，step 5b
  // 之後 orders 那一列已經是 paid。它的前提（訂單列已經說 paid）在這裡成立。
  //
  // 純活動報名的購物車不會有 invLines，這一句是 no-op；它自己吞掉所有錯誤且從不
  // throw，而且用 DELETE…RETURNING 當冪等 claim，所以多呼叫也不會壞。
  if (total === 0) await commitInventoryForOrder(order.id);

  // ---- step 7.5: 下單當下的信（0034）----------------------------------------
  // 這個站到 0033 為止**沒有任何一封信是在下單當下寄的**。四封信只有一個入口
  // queueOrderNotifications()，而它的第一道閘門就是「payment_status 不是 paid 就
  // 回 order_not_paid」（0022 §8）。這裡要寄的兩封信的前提正好相反：
  //
  //   · 匯款訂單 → 客人要收到帳號與期限，否則他不知道錢要匯去哪裡；
  //   · 匯款／「由我們與你聯繫付款」→ 店家要知道有一張待收款的單。0032 那封是
  //     付款成功之後才寄的，而這兩條路的訂單可能永遠走不到那一步 —— 沒有這一封，
  //     一張 offline 訂單就是靜靜躺著，兩小時後被 expire 掉，沒有任何人知道。
  //
  // ⚠️ 位置在 step 7 **之後**，而且**不在 try 裡**：訂單這時候已經 durable 了，
  //    寄信是「錦上添花」。放進上面那個 try 會讓一次 Resend 逾時變成「訂單建立
  //    失敗、座位還回去、客人看到請再試一次」—— 而客人的錢包什麼事都沒發生，
  //    只是他的位子沒了。triggerNotifyAfterOrderPlaced() 自己有逾時保護、自己
  //    吞掉所有例外、而且從不 throw（同 triggerNotifyAfterPayment 的規約）。
  //
  // ⚠️ 刷卡訂單不走這裡：它們的通知在付款成功之後由 0032 那條路寄。免費訂單
  //    （total = 0）也不走 —— step 5b 已經把它變成 paid，該走的是付款成功那條路。
  //    這個判斷寫在 queueOrderPlacedNotifications() 裡（它自己重讀 payment_method），
  //    不在這裡用 wantsTransfer 判斷：那樣才是「以資料庫那一列為準」。
